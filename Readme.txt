Loosely based on the moderncv template, laced access to the working code and was unable to access all the code so I made new code with a style in the general vicinity using as basic packages as possible.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Notes %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is a LaTeX project containing a CV and Applications using the same style.

The CV can be compiled as a compact or an extended version by use of the \extendedtrue tag in the CV document.

Some cv sections might have to be reorganised depending on their length, to get a smooth page transition.

Application are created in the Applications folder by coping the contents of the ApplicationsTemplate.tex file. The application is compiled using the Application.tex file and replacing * in "\input{Applications/*}" with you applicatioin file name.

%---------------- Selected Application ----------------------
\input{Applications/ApplicationTemplate.tex}
